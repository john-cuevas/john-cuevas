My name is John Cuevas, and my pronouns are he/him/his. I am a Software Engineer who is transitioning out of the civil engineering world. I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp where I learned full-stack web development with Python, MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js), and Java. I'm an adept, lifelong learner that works well in a team environment by utilizing project management experience, effective communication & critical thinking skills. 

I am seeking any internship or junior/entry-level positions where I can actively learn and start my new career. Currently, I am working to improve my critical thinking skills by completing algorithms with JavaScript. I am also working on side projects that will make others' lives around me easier.

Some of my passions include helping others and providing good customer service. I would love to join a team where I can truly make a difference with my work and do work that promotes equity and equality.
